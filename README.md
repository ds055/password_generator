## Usage
* Users will arrive at the website--perhaps discovered via a search engine.
* User will click on the "Generate Password" button. 
* User will enter the preferred length (between 8 and 128 characters) for their sample password.
* A series of prompts will offer various character types (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters). Users can add these characters to the potential bank of characters by selecting "OK" or exclude them from use by clicking "Cancel." 
* A final pop-up will display all user selections for a final confirmation. The "OK" button will generate the password with the given parameters. "Cancel" will send the user back to the beginning to make their desired selections. 
* If the generated password fails to fulfill user's wishes, another password can be created by entering the process again by clicking "Generate Password."
